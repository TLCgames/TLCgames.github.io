Three Kins is a number sense board game developed and trademarked by Lovence.

This project uses classes to create chip objects and a board object for game logic. With that setup, it's easier to attach multiple event handlers and event chaining to manipulate HTML and CSS.

To do list:
Prevent move repetition (moving the same piece back to last move position)
Restart game
Phase panel updates

Wood-style board background
Sound effects
Lifting pieces and moving them around
Fullscreen board / hiding side panels
