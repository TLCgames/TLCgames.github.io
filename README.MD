Three Kins is a number sense board game developed and trademarked by Lovence.

This project uses classes to create chip objects and a board object for game logic. With that setup, it's easier to attach multiple event handlers and event chaining to manipulate HTML and CSS.

__Latest updates__
* Restart game, preserving score (Start Game button becomes New Round button on round end)
* Bonus move functionality (extra move after scoring a point, a player can make up to 3 moves in a row)
* No repeat moves (you can't return a piece to its previous position during a bonus move)

__To do list__
* Allow for skipping bonus move
* Wood-style board background
* Phase panel updates
* Sound effects
* Lifting pieces and moving them around
* Fullscreen board button

__Overall plan__
1. Add pass turn button for bonus moves.
2. Require selecting which combination you made (and add 'no relation' button)
3. Fix display on phones once game is fully playable and mechanically in line with physical game.
4. Improve visuals, colors, and add sounds.
5. Add AI and/or multiplayer.
